## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Team.Create, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                              |
| Application                            | Team.Create, Teamwork.Migrate.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |

> **Note**: The Teamwork.Migrate.All permission is *only* supported for [migration](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/import-messages/import-external-messages-to-teams).
In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported.

> **Note**: Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.
